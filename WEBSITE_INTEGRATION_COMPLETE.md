## 📊 How It Works

### Form Submission Flow

```
User fills form → JavaScript captures data → POST to API → Database saves
       ↓                    ↓                      ↓              ↓
  Website Form      api-integration.js    http://localhost:5000   SQLite DB
                                              /api/leads
```

### Data Captured

**Every form submission saves:**
- First & Last Name
- Email address
- Company name
- Job title
- Phone number
- Lead source (which form)
- Lead status
- Fortune 500 detection
- Timestamp

### Fortune 500 Detection

The integration automatically detects Fortune 500 companies by email domain:
- `@microsoft.com` → Fortune 500 ✅
- `@apple.com` → Fortune 500 ✅
- `@google.com` → Fortune 500 ✅
- `@amazon.com` → Fortune 500 ✅
- `@jpmorgan.com` → Fortune 500 ✅
