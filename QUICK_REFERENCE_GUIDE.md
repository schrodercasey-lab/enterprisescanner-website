## 🔧 TECHNICAL QUICK REFERENCE

### CMDB Module (`cam_part5_advanced_integration.py`)

#### Initialize
```python
from backend.cmdb_asset_management.cam_part5_advanced_integration import AdvancedAssetDiscovery

discovery = AdvancedAssetDiscovery()
```

#### Discover AWS Resources
```python
aws_resources = discovery.discover_aws_resources(
    access_key="YOUR_AWS_KEY",
    secret_key="YOUR_SECRET",
    regions=['us-east-1', 'us-west-2']
)
```

#### Discover Containers
```python
containers = discovery.discover_docker_containers()
k8s_resources = discovery.discover_kubernetes_resources()
```

#### Software Inventory
```python
software = discovery.discover_software_on_asset("i-abc123")
vulns = discovery.correlate_vulnerabilities("i-abc123", cve_database)
```

#### Risk Scoring
```python
risk_score = discovery.calculate_asset_risk_score("i-abc123", "CRITICAL")
```

#### Cost Analysis
```python
costs = discovery.estimate_cloud_costs(aws_resources)
```

### Threat Intelligence Module (`threat_intel_part5_advanced_feeds.py`)

#### Initialize
```python
from backend.threat_intelligence.threat_intel_part5_advanced_feeds import AdvancedThreatIntelligence

threat_intel = AdvancedThreatIntelligence(api_keys={
    'otx': 'YOUR_OTX_KEY',
    'abuseipdb': 'YOUR_ABUSEIPDB_KEY'
})
```

#### Fetch Threat Feeds

## 💼 SALES TALKING POINTS

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
*"Enterprise Scanner now includes advanced CMDB and real-time threat intelligence that work together to give you complete asset visibility across AWS, Azure, containers, and on-prem—automatically correlated with 13+ government and commercial threat feeds including CISA and DoD. It's like having a security operations center that knows every asset you have and every threat targeting them, 24/7."*

### Key Differentiators (2 minutes)

1. **Integrated CMDB + Threat Intelligence**
   - "Unlike competitors who sell these separately, our platform integrates them automatically"
   - "This means when a new threat is discovered, we instantly know which of YOUR assets are at risk"

2. **Multi-Cloud Native**
   - "Native AWS, Azure, and GCP discovery—not bolt-on solutions"
   - "Automatic container and Kubernetes discovery"
   - "Modern infrastructure visibility out of the box"

3. **Government-Grade Intelligence**
   - "Direct integration with CISA, DoD, and FBI threat feeds"
   - "Critical for defense contractors and regulated industries"
   - "Access to known exploited vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog"

4. **Automatic Risk Prioritization**
   - "Our system automatically calculates risk scores based on asset criticality, vulnerabilities, and active threats"
   - "Focus on what matters most—critical assets with actively exploited vulnerabilities"

### ROI Calculator
```
Customer Scenario: 5,000 assets, 50% cloud, 2,000 vulnerabilities

WITHOUT Enterprise Scanner CMDB+TI:
- Manual asset discovery: 40 hours/month × $75/hour = $3,000/month
- Threat feed subscriptions: $5,000/month
- SIEM correlation engineering: 80 hours/month × $100/hour = $8,000/month
- Total: $16,000/month = $192,000/year

WITH Enterprise Scanner CMDB+TI:
- Automatic discovery: $0 labor
- Integrated threat feeds: Included
- Automatic correlation: $0 engineering
- Annual cost: $77,000/year

SAVINGS: $115,000/year (60% reduction)
PLUS: Faster threat response, better coverage, reduced risk
```
