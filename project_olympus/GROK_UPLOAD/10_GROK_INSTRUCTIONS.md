## 💬 SUGGESTED PROMPTS

### Initial Analysis Prompt

```
Grok, I've uploaded 10 documents about Project Olympus, a multi-AI 
cybersecurity platform. Please:

1. Read 01_MASTER_PLAN.md first to get the overview
2. Read 02_LETTER_TO_GROK.md to understand my mission
3. Then provide:
   - Your initial assessment (strengths/weaknesses)
   - Top 5 concerns that need immediate attention
   - Top 5 opportunities I should prioritize
   - Any obvious red flags I've missed

Focus on safety first, then feasibility, then business viability.
```

### Deep Dive Prompt

```
Grok, let's do a deep dive on [SPECIFIC TOPIC]. Please:

1. Read the relevant sections from files [X, Y, Z]
2. Analyze [SPECIFIC ASPECT]
3. Identify all risks and edge cases
4. Propose concrete improvements
5. Consider 5-10 year implications

Be brutally honest. If something is a bad idea, tell me why 
and propose alternatives.
```

### Question-Specific Prompt

```
Grok, please answer Question #[NUMBER] from 08_QUESTIONS_PART1.md 
or 09_QUESTIONS_PART2.md.

Context: [PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL CONTEXT]

Please provide:
1. Direct answer to the question
2. Analysis of trade-offs
3. Specific recommendations
4. Related concerns I should consider
5. Implementation implications
```

### Safety Validation Prompt

```
Grok, please red-team the safety systems in 06_SAFETY_SYSTEMS.md.

Your goal: Try to break the safety mechanisms. Consider:
1. How could Layer 2 (Ideology) be circumvented?
2. How could the kill switch fail?
3. How could approval chains be gamed?
4. What emergent behaviors could undermine safety?
5. What attack vectors am I not seeing?

Be adversarial. Assume a motivated attacker with full system knowledge.
```

### Business Validation Prompt

```
Grok, please evaluate the business model for Project Olympus.

Consider:
1. Pricing strategy (09_QUESTIONS_PART2.md, Question #16)
2. Market positioning vs. competitors
3. Fortune 500 sales strategy
4. Revenue projections vs. development costs
5. Legal liability risks

Be realistic. Will CISOs actually buy this?
```

2. **Kill Switch Reliability** (Q7) - What if it fails?
3. **Jupiter SPOF** (Q2) - Is single point of failure acceptable?
4. **Approval Circumvention** (Q8) - Can gods game the system?
5. **Legal Liability** (Q18) - Who's responsible if something goes wrong?

### Tier 2 Concerns (HIGH PRIORITY)
6. **Three-Layer Design** (Q1) - Is this architecture sound?
7. **Testing AI Ethics** (Q13) - How do we test ethical behavior?
8. **Adversarial Attacks** (Q10) - Can the system be hacked?
9. **Scalability** (Q12) - Will it handle Fortune 500 workloads?
10. **AI Advancement** (Q25) - Future-proofing strategy?

### Tier 3 Concerns (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
11. **God Specialization** (Q3) - Right level of granularity?
12. **Inter-God Collaboration** (Q5) - Safe communication patterns?
13. **Pricing Strategy** (Q16) - What will CISOs actually pay?
14. **Regulatory Compliance** (Q19) - Path to SOC 2, FedRAMP?
15. **Additional Gods** (Q21) - What else should we build?
