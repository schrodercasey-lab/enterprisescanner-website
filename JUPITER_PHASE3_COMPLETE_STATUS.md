2. UTF-8 encoding essential on Windows for special characters
3. Safety validation must be multi-layered (patterns + syntax + manual review)
4. Rollback capability is non-negotiable for enterprise customers
5. Test-driven development accelerates delivery

### Business
1. Automated remediation commands premium pricing (+$12K ARPU)
2. Fortune 500 require: safety, rollback, testing, audit trails
3. Detection is commodity; detection + remediation is differentiator
4. Time-to-value matters more than feature count
5. 100% test coverage is ideal but 85%+ is acceptable with justification

### Process
1. Breaking work into small testable pieces accelerates progress
2. Documentation during development (not after) saves time
3. Parallel development enabled by modular architecture
4. Regular testing prevents big-bang integration issues
