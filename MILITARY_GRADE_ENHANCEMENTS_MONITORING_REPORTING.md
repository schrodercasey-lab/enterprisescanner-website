## 📋 NEXT STEPS

### Option A: Full Military Implementation (Recommended)
**Timeline**: 8-10 months  
**Investment**: $111K-$178K  
**Outcome**: 98% defense-grade platform, $75M-$675M exit potential

### Option B: Phased Military Implementation
**Phase 1**: Critical security + compliance (4-5 months, $50K-$70K)  
**Phase 2**: Advanced analytics + scale (3-4 months, $35K-$55K)  
**Phase 3**: Certification (1-2 months, $26K-$53K)  
**Outcome**: Staggered investment, faster time to first DoD customer

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
**Military-Lite**: Implement top 50% of features (FedRAMP High, CMMC Level 3, IL4)  
**Timeline**: 4-6 months  
**Investment**: $50K-$90K  
**Outcome**: 95% defense-grade, smaller DoD customers ($200K-$500K ARR)

---

**Recommendation**: Proceed with **Option A (Full Military Implementation)** to maximize DoD market capture and exit valuation potential. The 8-10 month timeline aligns with typical DoD sales cycles (9-18 months), allowing parallel development and customer acquisition efforts.

**Immediate Action**: Begin Phase 1 (Critical Security) implementation next week to achieve FedRAMP High + CMMC Level 5 readiness within 15 weeks, enabling DoD customer demos by Q2 2026.
