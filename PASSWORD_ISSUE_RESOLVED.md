## 🔧 What Was the Solution?

**You already had SSH keys set up!**

The password prompts you were experiencing were likely:
1. **One-time occurrences** during initial SSH key setup
2. **VS Code terminal initialization** (first connection)
3. **Git credential helper** (one-time authentication)

Once SSH keys were properly configured, everything worked perfectly.

- **Location**: `~\.ssh\` (C:\Users\schro\.ssh\)
- **Server**: 134.199.147.45 (root@enterprisescanner.com)
- **Status**: ✅ Working perfectly

To verify your keys:
```powershell
ls ~\.ssh\
```

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### What Caused Initial Confusion:
1. **Normal SSH key setup process** - First-time password entry to install keys
2. **VS Code initialization** - Initial terminal setup may prompt once
3. **Misunderstanding of when prompts occur** - Profile load vs. script execution

### What We Discovered:
- PowerShell profile is clean (only function definitions)
- SSH keys were already configured correctly
- No actual issue with password prompts during normal operations
- All tests passed on first try after investigation

## 🎓 Technical Notes

### Why It Works Now:
1. **SSH Key Authentication**: Public/private key pair eliminates password need

## 📞 If You Ever See Password Prompts Again:

### Rare Cases That May Prompt:
1. **SSH key expires** (doesn't happen with current setup)
2. **Server authorized_keys file modified** (reinstall public key)
3. **First-time Git operation** (one-time, then cached)
4. **VS Code extension update** (one-time re-auth)

### Quick Fix:
```powershell
# Re-copy SSH public key to server (one password entry)
type ~\.ssh\id_rsa.pub | ssh root@134.199.147.45 "cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```
