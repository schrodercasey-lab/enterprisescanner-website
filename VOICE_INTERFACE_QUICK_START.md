# üöÄ QUICK START: Test Your Voice Interface (While Waiting for ID.me)

## ‚ö° 5-Minute Demo Setup

### Step 1: Start the Voice Server
```powershell
# Navigate to workspace
cd c:\Users\schro\OneDrive\Desktop\BugBountyScanner\workspace

# Install dependencies (if needed)
pip install flask flask-socketio openai elevenlabs python-dotenv

# Set API keys (create .env file)
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env
echo "ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_key_here" >> .env

# Start the voice server
python backend/ai_copilot/vr_ar/voice_nlp_server.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
 * Running on http://localhost:5005
 * SocketIO server started
JUPITER Voice Interface ready!
```

### Step 2: Open the Demo
```powershell
# Open the demo in your browser
start website/voice_nlp_demo.html
```

**What You'll See:**
- Beautiful chat interface with JUPITER's welcome message
- Microphone button for voice input
- Text input for keyboard queries
- Quick query buttons for common questions
- Voice personality selector
- Real-time statistics

### Step 3: Try These Queries

**Text Mode (No API Keys Required for Demo):**
1. Click in the text box
2. Type: "Show me all critical vulnerabilities"
3. Click send button (‚û§)
4. See JUPITER's response

**Voice Mode (Simulated):**
1. Click the microphone button üé§
2. It turns red üî¥ and shows voice waveform
3. Auto-stops after 3 seconds (simulated recording)
4. See random security query appear
5. JUPITER responds with answer

**Quick Queries:**
- Click "üî¥ Critical Vulnerabilities"
- Click "‚ö†Ô∏è Active Threats"
- Click "üìã Explain CVE"
- Click "üîß Remediation Steps"

## üéØ Demo Scenarios to Try

### Scenario 1: Threat Investigation
```
You: "Jupiter, show me all critical threats in the last 24 hours"
JUPITER: "I found 12 critical threats. The most severe is..."
You: "Show me the attack timeline"
JUPITER: "The attack started at 2:15 AM when..."
```

### Scenario 2: CVE Explanation
```
You: "Explain CVE-2024-1234"
JUPITER: "CVE-2024-1234 is a critical RCE vulnerability in Apache Struts..."
You: "How do I fix it?"
JUPITER: "I recommend running remediation playbook..."
```

### Scenario 3: Quick Investigation
```
You: "Find lateral movement from IP 10.0.1.42"
JUPITER: "IP 10.0.1.42 accessed 15 internal servers..."
You: "Who owns that IP?"
JUPITER: "That's workstation WS-IT-042 assigned to msmith..."
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start
**Problem:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'`
**Solution:**
```powershell
pip install flask flask-socketio openai elevenlabs python-dotenv
```

### Demo Shows Connection Error
**Problem:** Can't connect to server
**Solution:** 
1. Check server is running on port 5005
2. Look for "Running on http://localhost:5005" in terminal
3. Try refreshing browser

### Voice Recording Doesn't Work
**Problem:** Microphone not recording
**Solution:**
- This is expected - demo uses simulated voice for now
- Real microphone integration requires browser HTTPS
- For production, deploy to https://demo.enterprisescanner.com

### API Keys Missing
**Problem:** "OpenAI API key not configured"
**Solution:**
1. Get API key from https://platform.openai.com
2. Create `.env` file in workspace root
3. Add: `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here`
4. Restart server

Appears in chat interface
```

### Voice Query Flow (When Fully Integrated):
```
You speak into microphone
    ‚Üì
Browser captures audio
    ‚Üì
WebSocket sends base64 audio to server
    ‚Üì
SpeechProcessor transcribes (Whisper)
    ‚Üì
ConversationEngine processes query (GPT-4)

## üí° Pro Tips

**For Best Demo Experience:**
1. Use headphones to hear JUPITER's voice clearly
2. Test on Chrome/Edge (best WebSocket support)
3. Keep server terminal visible (shows real-time logs)
4. Prepare 3-5 security questions in advance
5. Show multi-turn conversation (ask follow-ups)

**For Development:**
1. Check browser console (F12) for WebSocket messages
2. Monitor server logs for request/response flow
3. Use quick queries to test different intent types
4. Try edge cases (gibberish, very long queries)
