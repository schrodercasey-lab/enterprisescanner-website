## üîß DETAILED WALKTHROUGH (For First-Time Setup)

### If You Need to Create Repository in cPanel:

**1. Fill Out Create Repository Form:**

| Field | Value | Example |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Clone URL** | `git@github.com:schrodercasey-lab/enterprisescanner-website.git` | Exact as shown |
| **Repository Path** | `/home/yourusername/repositories/enterprisescanner-website` | Use cPanel suggestion |
| **Repository Name** | `enterprisescanner-website` | Must match |

**2. SSH Key Setup (If Required):**

Some hosts require SSH key authentication:
- cPanel usually generates keys automatically
- Look for "Generate/Import Key" button if needed
- Or use HTTPS URL instead: `https://github.com/schrodercasey-lab/enterprisescanner-website.git`

**3. After Repository Created:**
- Click "Manage" on your new repository
- Go to "Pull or Deploy" tab
- Deployment Path: `/public_html/` or `/home/yourusername/public_html/`
- Click "Deploy HEAD Commit"

**4. Enable Auto-Deploy (Optional but HIGHLY Recommended):**
- In repository management, look for "Auto Deploy" or "Deploy on Push"
- Enable this option
- Future Git pushes will auto-deploy! üéâ

## üéØ ALTERNATIVE METHOD: GitHub Download + FTP

**If cPanel Git doesn't work, use this backup method:**

### Step 1: Download from GitHub (1 minute)
```
1. Go to: https://github.com/schrodercasey-lab/enterprisescanner-website
2. Click green "Code" button
3. Click "Download ZIP"
4. Save to your computer
5. Extract ZIP file
6. Open "website" folder (this has all the files)
```

### Step 2: Upload via FTP (3-5 minutes)
```
1. Open FTP client (FileZilla, WinSCP, or cPanel File Manager)
2. Connect to your hosting:
   - Host: ftp.yourdomain.com
   - Username: your cPanel username
   - Password: your cPanel password
   - Port: 21 (or 22 for SFTP)
3. Navigate to /public_html/ folder on server
4. Upload ALL files from extracted "website" folder
5. Overwrite existing files when prompted
6. Wait for upload to complete
7. üéâ JUPITER IS LIVE!
```

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: "Can't find Git Version Control in cPanel"

**Solution Options:**
1. Search for "Git" in cPanel search bar
2. Your host might not support Git - use FTP method instead
3. Contact hosting support to enable Git feature
4. Look under different sections (sometimes under "Advanced" or "Developer")

---

### Problem: "SSH key authentication failed"

**Solution:**
1. Use HTTPS URL instead of SSH:
   ```
   https://github.com/schrodercasey-lab/enterprisescanner-website.git
   ```
2. Or generate SSH key in cPanel:
   - Look for "SSH Access" or "Generate SSH Key"
   - Copy public key and add to GitHub settings
   - GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí SSH and GPG Keys ‚Üí New SSH Key

---

### Problem: "Repository created but files not showing on site"

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you clicked "Deploy HEAD Commit"
2. Check deployment path is correct: `/public_html/` not `/public_html/website/`
3. Files might be in subfolder - move them to web root
4. Clear browser cache: Ctrl + Shift + R

---

### Problem: "WiFi Eyes not working after deployment"

**Solution:**
1. **VERIFY HTTPS:** Must see padlock icon in browser
2. Check browser console (F12) for specific errors
3. Ensure camera permission granted in browser
4. Try different browser (Chrome/Edge recommended)
5. Verify files uploaded correctly (check file sizes match)

---

## üìû IF YOU GET STUCK

**Quick Help:**

1. **Check browser console (F12)** - Errors will show here
2. **Try FTP method** - Simpler if Git is problematic
3. **Contact hosting support** - They can help with cPanel Git setup
4. **Use staging URL first** - Test on subdomain before main site

**Most Common Issue:** Files in wrong directory
- Files should be directly in `/public_html/`
- NOT in `/public_html/website/` or `/public_html/enterprisescanner-website/`
