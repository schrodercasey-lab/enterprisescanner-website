## üéØ IDENTIFIED ISSUES (From Audit)

### Critical Priority (Blocking Production)
1. ‚ùå **Duplicate CRM Dashboard** - Two conflicting versions exist
   - Old: `website/crm-dashboard.html` (979 lines, uses SocketIO)
   - New: `website/admin/crm-dashboard.html` (working, uses simple_server)
   - **Action Needed**: Delete old version, redirect links

2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **No Authentication** - Admin dashboard publicly accessible
   - **Risk**: High - Anyone can access sensitive lead data
   - **Action Needed**: Implement login system using admin credentials from database

3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **SQLite in Production** - Not scalable for high traffic
   - **Action Needed**: Create PostgreSQL migration script

### High Priority (This Week)
4. ‚ùå **Missing Endpoints**: User management, API keys
5. ‚ùå **No Email Integration**: Can't send automated follow-ups
6. ‚ùå **Manual Lead Scoring**: Should be automated based on rules

### Medium Priority (This Month)
7. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Analytics Using Mock Data**: Some charts not connected to real database
8. ‚ö†Ô∏è **No Test Coverage**: 0% test coverage on backend
9. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limited Error Handling**: Some edge cases not covered

## üí° KEY INSIGHTS FROM AUDIT

### Strengths Discovered
- **Clean architecture**: Backend/frontend well separated
- **Reusable components**: api-integration.js works universally
