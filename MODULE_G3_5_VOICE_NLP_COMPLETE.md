## 🧪 TESTING & VALIDATION

### Demo Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Threat Investigation**
```
User: "Jupiter, show me all critical threats in the last 24 hours"
JUPITER: "I found 12 critical threats. The most severe is a ransomware 
          outbreak on subnet 10.0.1.0/24. Would you like me to show the 
          attack timeline?"
User: "Yes, show the timeline"
JUPITER: "The attack started at 2:15 AM when user jdoe@company.com opened 
          a phishing email. The malware encrypted 47 servers over 3 hours."
```

**Scenario 2: CVE Explanation**
```
User: "Explain CVE-2024-1234"
JUPITER: "CVE-2024-1234 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability 
          in Apache Struts 2. It allows attackers to execute arbitrary 
          commands via crafted HTTP requests. You have 8 servers affected."
User: "How do I fix it?"
JUPITER: "I recommend running remediation playbook 'Apache-Struts-RCE-Fix'. 
          This will patch all 8 servers and validate the fix. Should I 
          execute it?"
```

**Scenario 3: Multi-Turn Investigation**
```
User: "Find lateral movement from IP 10.0.1.42"
JUPITER: "IP 10.0.1.42 accessed 15 internal servers in the past hour. 
          This is suspicious behavior for a workstation."
User: "Who owns that IP?"
JUPITER: "That's workstation WS-IT-042 assigned to user msmith. They're 
          in the IT department."
User: "Block that IP"
JUPITER: "Executing firewall block rule for 10.0.1.42. The IP is now 
          isolated from the network."
```
