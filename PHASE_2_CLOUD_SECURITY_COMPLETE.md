### 5. SecurityAssessmentEngine Integration - 100+ Lines
**Seamless Cloud Security Assessment Workflow**

#### Integration Points:
1. **Import Statement**: Added `MultiCloudSecurityScanner` to advanced scanning modules
2. **Initialization**: `self.cloud_scanner = MultiCloudSecurityScanner()` in `__init__()`
3. **Assessment Workflow**: New Phase 4C - Cloud Security Assessment (75% progress marker)
4. **Scan Method**: `_run_cloud_security_scan()` with multi-cloud support
5. **Scoring Integration**: Cloud security score (20% weight) in overall calculation
6. **Results Consolidation**: Cloud findings added to unified findings list

#### Phase 4C: Cloud Security Assessment
```python
# Progress update at 75%
self.update_progress(self.assessment_id, 75, "Running cloud security assessment...")

# Cloud security scanning
cloud_security_score = self._run_cloud_security_scan(assessment_data)
```

#### `_run_cloud_security_scan()` Method Features:
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: AWS, Azure, GCP, and MULTI-cloud configurations
- **Dynamic Configuration**: 
  - AWS: `access_key`, `secret_key`, `region`, `profile_name`
  - Azure: `subscription_id`, `tenant_id`, `client_id`, `client_secret`
  - GCP: `project_id`, `credentials_path`
  - MULTI: Configures all provided credentials, scans all clouds
- **Result Conversion**: Multi-cloud findings ‚Üí assessment format
- **Risk Score Inversion**: `security_score = 100 - risk_score` (higher = more secure)
- **Performance Optimization**: Top 20 findings limit
- **Return Format**: `{score, findings, category, metadata}`

#### Updated Scoring Algorithm:
```python
weights = {
    'infrastructure': 0.08,     # Basic server security
    'network': 0.12,            # Network configuration
    'advanced_ports': 0.12,     # Comprehensive port scanning
    'ssl': 0.12,                # SSL/TLS security
    'vulnerability': 0.12,      # CVE detection
    'web_app': 0.12,            # OWASP Top 10
    'api_security': 0.08,       # REST/GraphQL/SOAP
    'cloud_security': 0.20,     # ‚≠ê Cloud security (HIGHEST WEIGHT)
    'compliance': 0.04          # Compliance frameworks
}

overall_score = weighted_sum(all_category_scores)
```

**Why Cloud Security Has 20% Weight:**
- 95% of cloud security failures due to misconfiguration (Gartner)
- Average cloud breach cost: $4.45M (IBM 2024)
- 83% of enterprises use multi-cloud (Flexera 2024)
