## üî¨ TECHNICAL APPROACH: WiFi CSI Vision

### **How It Works:**

**WiFi CSI (Channel State Information):**
- WiFi signals bounce off objects, people, and walls
- Signal reflections create unique "fingerprints"
- Machine learning analyzes patterns to detect:
  - Human movement
  - Gestures (wave, point, grab)
  - Object locations
  - Door openings
  - Even breathing patterns!

**Hardware Needed:**
- 3+ WiFi access points (already in every enterprise!)
- Special WiFi cards with CSI extraction (or modify existing)
- Processing server (runs ML models)

**No Cameras Required:**
- Privacy-preserving (no visual images)
- Works in darkness
- Penetrates walls
- Perfect for classified/secure facilities

## üí° KILLER USE CASES

### **1. Physical-Cyber Attack Correlation** ‚≠ê GAME CHANGER
**Scenario:**
```
2:14 AM - JUPITER detects unauthorized person near database server (WiFi)
2:14 AM - Anomalous database queries execute (SIEM)
2:15 AM - Data exfiltration begins (network monitoring)

JUPITER's Conclusion:
"High confidence insider threat. Person at server physically + malware 
execution = coordinated attack. Recommend: Lock account, alert security,
isolate server. Confidence: 94%"
```

**Value:** No other cybersecurity platform can do this!

### **2. Gesture Recognition for VR**
**Scenario:**
```
User waves hand ‚Üí WiFi detects gesture ‚Üí JUPITER dismisses alert
User points at server ‚Üí WiFi tracks gesture ‚Üí JUPITER shows server details
User swipes left ‚Üí WiFi recognizes motion ‚Üí JUPITER shows next threat
```

**Value:** Natural interaction without controllers!

### **3. Insider Threat Detection**
**Scenario:**
```
Employee normally in accounting department (WiFi tracking)
3:00 AM - Same employee detected near server room (WiFi anomaly)
3:02 AM - Privileged credentials used to access payroll database (SIEM)

JUPITER: "Insider threat detected. Employee outside normal area + 
unusual hours + data access = 89% confidence malicious intent."
```

**Value:** Catches insider threats traditional systems miss!

### **4. Security Operations Center (SOC) Safety**
**Scenario:**
```
Analyst working alone at night
WiFi detects fall or no movement for 30 minutes
JUPITER: "Analyst may need medical assistance. Alerting emergency contacts."
```

**Value:** Employee safety + security monitoring!

### **5. Zero-Trust Physical Access**
**Scenario:**
```
Person enters server room (WiFi detection)
JUPITER: "Who are you?" (voice interaction)
If no valid response ‚Üí Lock doors, alert security
If valid but suspicious activity ‚Üí Monitor closely
```

**Value:** Physical zero-trust architecture!
