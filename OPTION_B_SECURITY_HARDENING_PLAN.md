# OPTION B: SECURITY HARDENING PLAN

**Status:** üöÄ Starting Implementation  
**Started:** October 16, 2025, 04:11 UTC  
**Priority:** High - Production Server Security

---

## üéØ Security Hardening Objectives

Implement enterprise-grade security measures to protect the production platform from:
- Unauthorized access attempts
- DDoS and brute force attacks
- Common web vulnerabilities
- Network-based threats
- Malicious traffic

---

## üìã Implementation Tasks (7 Steps)

### Task 1: Configure UFW Firewall ‚è≥
**Purpose:** Control network traffic and block unauthorized connections

**Actions:**
- Install UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
- Allow SSH (port 22) - temporary, will change later
- Allow HTTP (port 80) - redirects to HTTPS
- Allow HTTPS (port 443) - primary access
- Block all other incoming traffic
- Enable firewall

**Expected Result:** Only essential ports accessible from internet

---

### Task 2: Install fail2ban Protection ‚è≥
**Purpose:** Automatically block IPs after failed login attempts

**Actions:**
- Install fail2ban service
- Configure SSH jail (5 failed attempts = 10 min ban)
- Configure Nginx jails (rate limiting, bad bots)
- Enable email notifications (optional)
- Start and enable service

**Expected Result:** Automated protection against brute force attacks

---

### Task 3: Harden SSH Configuration ‚è≥
**Purpose:** Secure remote access to the server

**Actions:**
- Disable root login via SSH
- Change SSH port from 22 to custom port (e.g., 2222)
- Disable password authentication (key-only)
- Set maximum authentication attempts to 3
- Configure SSH timeout settings
- Update UFW rules for new port

**Expected Result:** SSH access highly secured, harder to attack

---

### Task 4: Add Security Headers ‚è≥
**Purpose:** Protect against common web vulnerabilities

**Headers to Add:**
- **HSTS:** Force HTTPS for 1 year (max-age=31536000)
- **X-Frame-Options:** Prevent clickjacking (DENY)
- **X-Content-Type-Options:** Prevent MIME sniffing (nosniff)
- **X-XSS-Protection:** Enable XSS filtering (1; mode=block)
- **Content-Security-Policy:** Restrict resource loading
- **Referrer-Policy:** Control referrer information

**Expected Result:** A+ rating on security scanners

---

### Task 5: Enable Automatic Security Updates ‚è≥
**Purpose:** Keep system patched against known vulnerabilities

**Actions:**
- Install unattended-upgrades package
- Configure automatic security updates
- Set up email notifications for updates
- Enable automatic reboot if needed (off-hours)

**Expected Result:** System stays current with security patches

---

### Task 6: Implement Rate Limiting ‚è≥
**Purpose:** Prevent API abuse and DoS attacks

**Actions:**
- Configure Nginx rate limiting zones
- Set limits: 10 requests/second per IP for APIs
- Set burst allowance: 20 requests
- Add rate limiting to all API endpoints
- Configure custom error pages for rate-limited users

**Expected Result:** Protection against API abuse and simple DoS

---

### Task 7: Security Audit and Verification ‚è≥
**Purpose:** Validate all security measures are working

**Actions:**
- Test firewall rules (port scanning)
- Verify fail2ban is blocking attacks
- Test SSH hardening (attempt unauthorized access)
- Verify security headers with online tools
- Check for open ports and vulnerabilities
- Document final security posture

**Expected Result:** Comprehensive security verification report

---

## üîí Security Standards Applied

- **OWASP Best Practices:** Web application security
- **CIS Benchmarks:** Ubuntu server hardening
- **NIST Guidelines:** Cybersecurity framework
- **PCI DSS Concepts:** Network security (if handling payments)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Before Starting:
1. **Backup SSH Access:** Ensure you have console access via DigitalOcean in case SSH breaks
2. **Keep Current Session Open:** Don't close SSH until new configuration is verified
3. **Test Each Step:** Verify functionality before moving to next task

### Rollback Plans:
- UFW: `ufw disable` (via console if locked out)
- SSH: Keep backup of /etc/ssh/sshd_config
- Nginx: Backup config before adding security headers
- fail2ban: Can be stopped without breaking services

---

## üìä Expected Security Improvements

| Measure | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Open Ports | All accessible | Only 80, 443, SSH |
| Brute Force Protection | None | Automated IP blocking |
| SSH Security | Password auth, root login | Key-only, no root, custom port |
| Web Headers | Basic | Enterprise security headers |
| Patch Management | Manual | Automatic security updates |
| API Protection | None | Rate limiting active |

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

‚úÖ Firewall active with minimal open ports  
‚úÖ fail2ban catching and blocking malicious IPs  
‚úÖ SSH hardened and accessible only via key  
‚úÖ Security headers returning A+ rating  
‚úÖ Automatic updates configured  
‚úÖ Rate limiting protecting APIs  
‚úÖ Full security audit passed  

---

## üöÄ Ready to Begin!

Starting with Task 1: UFW Firewall Configuration...

**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes for all 7 tasks
**Risk Level:** Medium (SSH changes require careful execution)
**Reversibility:** High (all changes can be rolled back)
