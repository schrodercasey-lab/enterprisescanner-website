## Technical Details

### Phishing Simulation Algorithm

```python
# Risk scoring formula
risk_score = (
    click_rate * 0.4 +              # 40%: Susceptibility
    (100 - report_rate) * 0.3 +     # 30%: Awareness
    training_penalty * 0.15 +        # 15%: Training gap
    recent_failures * 0.15           # 15%: Recent trend
)

# Risk levels
0-29:   LOW (security champion)
30-49:  MEDIUM (average awareness)
50-69:  HIGH (needs attention)
70-100: CRITICAL (immediate training required)
```

### Behavior Scoring Algorithm

```python
# Behavior score calculation
behavior_score = (
    training_completion_rate * 0.30 +  # 30%: Training engagement
    avg_quiz_score * 0.25 +            # 25%: Knowledge retention
    phish_test_pass_rate * 0.25 +      # 25%: Real-world performance
    certifications * 0.10 +             # 10%: Professional development
    incident_reporting_accuracy * 0.10  # 10%: Security participation
)

# Behavior levels
85-100: Excellent (security champion)
70-84:  Good (solid awareness)
50-69:  Needs Improvement
0-49:   High Risk (immediate action)
```

### Campaign Effectiveness Metrics

| Metric | Good | Average | Poor |
|--------|------|---------|------|
| Click Rate | <10% | 10-20% | >20% |
| Report Rate | >50% | 30-50% | <30% |
| Time to Report | <5 min | 5-15 min | >15 min |
| Training Completion | >90% | 70-90% | <70% |
