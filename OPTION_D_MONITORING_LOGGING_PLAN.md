## 📋 Implementation Tasks (7 Steps)

### Task 1: Install Prometheus Monitoring ⏳
**Purpose:** Collect metrics from all services and infrastructure

**Actions:**
- Deploy Prometheus container
- Configure scrape targets (all services)
- Set up data retention (30 days)
- Configure web UI access
- Test metrics collection

**Metrics to Collect:**
- System: CPU, memory, disk, network
- Services: Request rate, response time, error rate
- Database: Connections, queries, transaction rate
- Application: Custom business metrics

**Expected Result:** Prometheus collecting metrics every 15 seconds

---

### Task 2: Setup Grafana Dashboards ⏳
**Purpose:** Visualize metrics with beautiful, informative dashboards

**Actions:**
- Deploy Grafana container
- Connect to Prometheus data source
- Import pre-built dashboards
- Configure user authentication
- Set up default home dashboard

**Dashboards to Create:**
1. **System Overview** - CPU, memory, disk, network
2. **Application Health** - Service status, response times
3. **Database Metrics** - Queries, connections, performance
4. **Web Server** - Requests, status codes, bandwidth
5. **Business KPIs** - Scans, vulnerabilities, users

**Expected Result:** 5+ dashboards accessible via web UI

---

### Task 3: Configure Centralized Logging ⏳
**Purpose:** Aggregate logs from all services in one place

**Actions:**
- Configure Docker logging driver
- Set up log rotation
- Create log viewing dashboard
- Configure log retention (30 days)
- Add log search capabilities

**Logs to Collect:**
- Nginx access and error logs
- Backend service logs
- PostgreSQL logs
- System logs (auth, cron, fail2ban)
- Docker container logs

**Expected Result:** All logs searchable from single interface

---

### Task 4: Install Metric Exporters ⏳
**Purpose:** Export specialized metrics from key components

**Exporters to Install:**
1. **Node Exporter** - System metrics
   - CPU, memory, disk I/O, network
   - Port: 9100

2. **PostgreSQL Exporter** - Database metrics
   - Connections, queries, cache hit rate
   - Port: 9187

3. **Nginx Exporter** - Web server metrics
   - Active connections, requests/sec
   - Port: 9113

**Expected Result:** All exporters feeding data to Prometheus

---

### Task 5: Setup Alerting System ⏳
**Purpose:** Get notified of critical issues immediately

**Alert Rules to Create:**
- Service down (any backend service offline)
- High CPU usage (> 80% for 5 minutes)
- High memory usage (> 90%)
- Disk space low (< 10% free)
- Database connection errors
- High error rate (> 5% of requests)
- SSL certificate expiring (< 30 days)
- Backup failures

**Notification Channels:**
- Email alerts
- Webhook for Slack/Discord (optional)
- Log all alerts to file

**Expected Result:** Test alerts triggering correctly

---

### Task 6: Create Custom Dashboards ⏳
**Purpose:** Monitor business metrics and application KPIs

**Custom Metrics:**
- Total scans performed
- Vulnerabilities discovered (by severity)
- Active users
- API request volume
- Average scan duration
- Database size growth
- Backup success rate

**Dashboard Features:**
- Real-time data updates
- Time range selector
- Drill-down capabilities
- Export to PDF

**Expected Result:** Executive-ready dashboard for business metrics

---

### Task 7: Verify Monitoring System ⏳
**Purpose:** End-to-end testing of monitoring and alerting

**Tests:**
1. Stop a service, verify alert triggers
2. Generate high load, check metrics
3. Search logs for specific events
4. Test dashboard auto-refresh
5. Verify data retention
6. Test backup monitoring
7. Check alert notifications

**Expected Result:** Complete monitoring system operational

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Monitoring Stack Deployment:
```yaml
services:
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus
    ports: 9090
    volumes: prometheus-data
    
  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana
    ports: 3000
    volumes: grafana-data
    
  node_exporter:
    image: prom/node-exporter
    ports: 9100
    
  postgres_exporter:
    image: prometheuscommunity/postgres-exporter
    ports: 9187
```

### Access URLs:
- **Prometheus:** http://localhost:9090
- **Grafana:** http://localhost:3000 (or https via Nginx proxy)
- **Node Exporter:** http://localhost:9100/metrics
- **Postgres Exporter:** http://localhost:9187/metrics

## 📈 Metrics to Monitor

### System Metrics:
- CPU usage (per core and total)
- Memory usage (used, free, cached)
- Disk I/O (read/write operations)
- Network traffic (in/out bandwidth)
- Disk space (used/available per partition)
- System load (1min, 5min, 15min averages)

### Application Metrics:
- HTTP request rate
- Response time (avg, p95, p99)
- Error rate (4xx, 5xx)
- Active connections
- Queue depths
- Cache hit rates

### Database Metrics:
- Active connections
- Query rate (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Transaction rate
- Cache hit ratio
- Slow queries
- Database size

### Business Metrics:
- Scans performed (daily, weekly, monthly)

- **Grafana:** ~100-200 MB RAM, minimal disk
- **Exporters:** ~50 MB RAM each
- **Total:** ~500 MB additional RAM usage

### Security Considerations:
- Grafana accessible via HTTPS through Nginx proxy
- Prometheus metrics endpoints secured (localhost only)
- Grafana authentication required
- No sensitive data in metrics/logs

### Data Retention:
- **Metrics:** 30 days in Prometheus
- **Logs:** 30 days with rotation
- **Backups:** Include Grafana dashboards
