## 🚀 3-STEP PROCESS

### **STEP 1: Configure DNS (5 minutes)**

Log into your domain registrar and add these DNS records:

```
Type    Name    Value
────────────────────────────
A       @       134.199.147.45
A       www     134.199.147.45
```

**Where to buy/configure domain:**
- GoDaddy: https://www.godaddy.com
- Namecheap: https://www.namecheap.com
- Google Domains: https://domains.google

**Then test:**
```powershell
# On your computer
nslookup enterprisescanner.com
# Should show: 134.199.147.45
```

---

### **STEP 2: Run Automated Script (10 minutes)**

**On your DigitalOcean server:**

```bash
cd /opt/enterprisescanner

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schrodercasey-lab/enterprisescanner-website/main/setup_domain_ssl_automated.sh

chmod +x setup_domain_ssl_automated.sh

sudo ./setup_domain_ssl_automated.sh
```

**The script automatically:**
- ✅ Checks DNS
- ✅ Installs Certbot
- ✅ Generates SSL certificates
- ✅ Configures Nginx for HTTPS
- ✅ Sets up automatic renewal
- ✅ Restarts services

---

### **STEP 3: Test (2 minutes)**

1. **Open in browser:**
   - https://enterprisescanner.com
   - Should show 🔒 lock icon

2. **Test redirect:**
   - http://enterprisescanner.com
   - Should redirect to HTTPS

3. **Check SSL rating:**
   - https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=enterprisescanner.com
   - Target: A or A+

---

## 📋 What You'll Get

✅ **Professional HTTPS URL**
- https://enterprisescanner.com
- https://www.enterprisescanner.com

✅ **Free SSL Certificate**
- Issued by Let's Encrypt
- Automatically renews every 90 days
- No action needed

✅ **Enterprise Security**
- TLS 1.2/1.3 encryption

## ⏱️ Timeline

- **DNS Configuration:** 5 minutes + 5-15 minute wait
- **Script Execution:** 10 minutes
- **Testing:** 2 minutes

## 🔍 Quick Troubleshooting

**DNS doesn't resolve:**
- Wait longer (can take up to 48 hours)
- Verify A records at registrar
- Test: `nslookup enterprisescanner.com`

**SSL certificate fails:**
- Make sure DNS points to 134.199.147.45 first
- Port 80 must be accessible
- Check rate limit (5 certs per week max)

**HTTPS doesn't work:**
- Check port 443: `netstat -tuln | grep 443`
- View logs: `docker logs enterprisescanner_nginx`
- Verify certificate: `certbot certificates`
