**Forensics → Incident Response + Compliance**:
- Investigation findings feed into incident timelines
- Legal hold integrates with data retention policies
- Evidence chain of custody supports audit trails

### API Integration Points

```python
# Example: Integrated workflow across all Tier 2 upgrades

from backend.red_team.red_team_part1_campaigns import RedTeamEngine
from backend.iam.iam_part1_pam import PrivilegedAccessManager
from backend.security_awareness.awareness_part1_phishing_simulation import PhishingSimulationEngine
from backend.forensics.forensics_part1_evidence_collection import DigitalForensicsEngine

# Scenario: Suspicious privileged access detected

# 1. Red Team identifies attack path
red_team = RedTeamEngine()
campaign = red_team.create_campaign(
    name="Privilege Escalation Test",
    attack_type="privilege_escalation",
    targets=["user_john_smith"]
)

# 2. IAM detects anomalous privileged access
pam = PrivilegedAccessManager()
session = pam.checkout_credential(
    credential_id="DB_ADMIN_CRED",
    requested_by="john.smith",
    purpose="Routine maintenance"
)
# Alert: Access outside normal hours + unusual database queries

# 3. Security Awareness checks user's training status
phishing = PhishingSimulationEngine()
risk_profile = phishing.employee_risks.get("john.smith")
# Finding: Recent phishing test failures, high risk score

# 4. Forensics initiates investigation
forensics = DigitalForensicsEngine()
case = forensics.create_case(
    case_name="Suspicious Privileged Access - John Smith",
    incident_type="insider_threat",
    lead_investigator="Security Team"
)

evidence = forensics.collect_evidence(
    case_id=case.case_id,
    evidence_type="memory_dump",
    source="john_smith_workstation"
)

# Result: Comprehensive investigation with evidence from all modules
