## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISKS & MITIGATION

### **Technical Risks:**

**Risk 1: VR/AR Adoption Slower Than Expected**
- **Probability:** Medium (30%)
- **Impact:** Medium (reduces ARPU $50K-$75K)
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Build WebXR (no headset required)
  - Offer VR as optional add-on (not core platform)
  - Focus on ROI messaging (time saved, threat detection)
  - Partner with VR hardware vendors (Meta, Microsoft)

**Risk 2: Patent Rejection or Challenge**
- **Probability:** Low (15%)
- **Impact:** Medium (loses competitive moat)
- **Mitigation:**
  - File continuation patents on specific features
  - Build strong prior art defense
  - File international patents (PCT)
  - Focus on trade secrets for non-patentable IP

**Risk 3: Technical Complexity Delays Development**
- **Probability:** Medium (30%)
- **Impact:** Low (delays revenue 1-2 quarters)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Build to order (only what customers need)
  - Hire experienced VR engineers
  - Use proven frameworks (Unity, OpenXR)
  - Simplify scope if needed

### **Market Risks:**

**Risk 4: Competitive Response from Incumbents**
- **Probability:** High (60%)
- **Impact:** High (could reduce pricing power 20-30%)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Patent protection delays competitor VR entry 12-24 months
  - Build strong customer relationships (switching costs)
  - Continuous innovation (stay ahead)
  - Focus on integration advantage (CMDB + TI + VR)

**Risk 5: Economic Downturn Reduces IT Budgets**
- **Probability:** Medium (40%)
- **Impact:** High (slows customer acquisition 30-50%)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Focus on ROI and cost savings messaging
  - Offer flexible pricing (monthly vs annual)
  - Target security budgets (less discretionary than IT)
  - Expand to government (recession-resistant)

**Risk 6: Customer Concentration (Few Large Customers)**
- **Probability:** Medium (40%)
- **Impact:** High (loss of 1 customer = 10-20% ARR)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Diversify customer base (50+ customers by 2027)
  - No single customer >10% of ARR
  - Annual contracts with auto-renewal
  - Strong customer success program

### **Execution Risks:**

**Risk 7: Series A Fundraising Fails or Delays**
- **Probability:** Low (20%)
- **Impact:** High (stunts growth, runway issues)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Bootstrap with customer revenue ($2.5M ARR by Q2 2026)
  - Reduce burn if needed (extend runway to 24+ months)
  - Consider alternative funding (venture debt, strategic)
  - Focus on profitability if fundraising not viable

**Risk 8: Key Employee Departure**
- **Probability:** Medium (30%)
- **Impact:** Medium (slows development 1-2 quarters)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Competitive comp (equity + salary)
  - Strong company culture and mission
  - Knowledge documentation and cross-training
  - Retention bonuses for critical roles
